# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 2: Import
# Instructions
# In a file named func.py create a function that sum 2 numbers, and prints the result
# In a file named exercise_one.py import the function and call it to print the result
# Hint: You can use the the following syntaxes:

# import module_name 

# OR 

# from module_name import function_name 

# OR 

# from module_name import function_name as fn 

# OR

# import module_name as mn



# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 3: String module

# Generate random String of length 5
# Note: String must be the combination of the UPPER case and lower case letters only. No numbers and a special symbol.
# Hint: use the string module

# Exercise 7 : Faker Module
# Instructions
