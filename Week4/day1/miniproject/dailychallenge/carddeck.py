# The Deck of cards class should NOT inherit from a Card class.

# The requirements are as follows:

# The Card class should have a suit (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades) and a value (A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K)
# The Deck class :
# should have a shuffle method which makes sure the deck of cards has all 52 cards and then rearranges them randomly.
# should have a method called deal which deals a single card from the deck. After a card is dealt, it should be removed from the deck.
