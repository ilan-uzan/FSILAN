#ðŸŒŸ Exercise 2: Tuple
#Instructions
#Given a tuple which value is integers, is it possible to add more integers to the tuple?

No, you can't add more numbers to a tuple because tuples are immutable. This means that once a tuple is created, you canâ€™t change itâ€”no adding, removing, or modifying elements. If you need a collection that allows changes, you might want to use a list instead.
