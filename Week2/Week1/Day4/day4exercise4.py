#ðŸŒŸ Exercise 4: Floats
#Instructions
#Recap â€“ What is a float? What is the difference between an integer and a float?
#Create a list containing the following sequence of floats and integers (it should be a list with mixed types): 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5 (donâ€™t hard-code the sequence).
#Can you think of another way to generate a sequence of floats?

#A float is a type of number that contains a decimal point. An integer is whole number whitout a decimal point.

list = [1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]
print(list)

#Another way to generate a sequence of floats is by using the range() function. For example, to generate a sequence of floats from 1.5 to 5 with a step of 0.5:
list = [float(i) for i in range(15, 51, 5)]
print(list)
