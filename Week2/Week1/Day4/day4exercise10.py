#Exercise 10 : Sandwich Orders
#Instructions
#Using the list below :

#sandwich_orders = ["Tuna sandwich", "Pastrami sandwich", "Avocado sandwich", "Pastrami sandwich", "Egg sandwich", "Chicken sandwich", "Pastrami sandwich"]

#The deli has run out of pastrami, use a while loop to remove all occurrences of “Pastrami sandwich” from sandwich_orders.
#We need to prepare the orders of the clients:
#Create an empty list called finished_sandwiches.
#One by one, remove each sandwich from the sandwich_orders while adding them to the finished_sandwiches list.
#After all the sandwiches have been made, print a message listing each sandwich that was made, such as:
#I made your tuna sandwich
#I made your avocado sandwich
#I made your egg sandwich
#I made your chicken sandwich

sandwich_orders = ["Tuna sandwich", "Pastrami sandwich", "Avocado sandwich", "Pastrami sandwich", "Egg sandwich", "Chicken sandwich", "Pastrami sandwich"]
while "Pastrami sandwich" in sandwich_orders:
    sandwich_orders.remove("Pastrami sandwich")
finished_sandwiches = []
for sandwich in sandwich_orders:
    finished_sandwiches.append(sandwich)
    print(f"I made your {sandwich.lower()}")
print(finished_sandwiches)
