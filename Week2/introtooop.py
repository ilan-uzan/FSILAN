# üåü Exercise 1: Cats
# Instructions
# Using this class

class Cat:
    def __init__(self, cat_name, cat_age):
         self.name = cat_name
         self.age = cat_age
# Instantiate three Cat objects using the code provided above.

cat1 = Cat("Tom", 7)
cat2 = Cat("Edward", 3)
cat3 = Cat("Jupiter", 21)

# Outside of the class, create a function that finds the oldest cat and returns the cat.
def find_oldest_cat(*cats):
    return max(cats, key=lambda cat: cat.age)
# Print the following string: ‚ÄúThe oldest cat is <cat_name>, and is <cat_age> years old.‚Äù. Use the function previously created.
oldest_cat = find_oldest_cat(cat1, cat2, cat3)
print(f"The oldest cat is {oldest_cat.name}, and is {oldest_cat.age} years old.")

# üåü Exercise 2 : Dogs
# Instructions
# Create a class called Dog.
# In this class, create an __init__ method that takes two parameters : name and height. This function instantiates two attributes, which values are the parameters.
# Create a method called bark that prints the following string ‚Äú<dog_name> goes woof!‚Äù.
# Create a method called jump that prints the following string ‚Äú<dog_name> jumps <x> cm high!‚Äù. x is the height*2.
# Outside of the class, create an object called davids_dog. His dog‚Äôs name is ‚ÄúRex‚Äù and his height is 50cm.
# Print the details of his dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
# Create an object called sarahs_dog. Her dog‚Äôs name is ‚ÄúTeacup‚Äù and his height is 20cm.
# Print the details of her dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
# Create an if statement outside of the class to check which dog is bigger. Print the name of the bigger dog.

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, height):
        self.name = name
        self.height = height

    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} goes woof!")

    def jump(self):
        print(f"{self.name} jumps {self.height *2} cm high!")

davids_dog = Dog("Rex", 50)
print(f"David's dog: Name - {davids_dog.name}, Height - {davids_dog.height} cm")
davids_dog.bark()
davids_dog.jump()

sarahs_dog = Dog("Teacup", 20)
print(f"Sarah' dog: Name - {sarahs_dog.name}, Height - {sarahs_dog.height} cm")
sarahs_dog.bark()
sarahs_dog.jump()


# üåü Exercise 3 : Who‚Äôs the song producer?
# Instructions
# 1. Define a class called Song, it will show the lyrics of a song.
# Its __init__() method should have two arguments: self and lyrics (a list).
# 2. Inside your class create a method called sing_me_a_song that prints each element of lyrics on its own line.
# 3. Create an object, for example:

# stairway= Song(["There‚Äôs a lady who's sure","all that glitters is gold", "and she‚Äôs buying a stairway to heaven"])


# 4. Then, call the sing_me_a_song method. The output should be:

# There‚Äôs a lady who's sure

# all that glitters is gold

# and she‚Äôs buying a stairway to heaven

class Song:
    def __init__(self, lyrics):
        self.lyrics = lyrics

    def sing_me_a_song(self):
        for line in self.lyrics:
            print(line)

stairway= Song(["There‚Äôs a lady who's sure","all that glitters is gold", "and she‚Äôs buying a stairway to heaven"])
stairway.sing_me_a_song()

# Exercise 4 : Afternoon at the Zoo
# Instructions
# Create a class called Zoo.
# In this class create a method __init__ that takes one parameter: zoo_name.
# It instantiates two attributes: animals (an empty list) and name (name of the zoo).
# Create a method called add_animal that takes one parameter new_animal. This method adds the new_animal to the animals list as long as it isn‚Äôt already in the list.
# Create a method called get_animals that prints all the animals of the zoo.
# Create a method called sell_animal that takes one parameter animal_sold. This method removes the animal from the list and of course the animal needs to exist in the list.
# Create a method called sort_animals that sorts the animals alphabetically and groups them together based on their first letter.
# Example

# { 
#     A: "Ape",
#     B: ["Baboon", "Bear"],
#     C: ['Cat', 'Cougar'],
#     E: ['Eel', 'Emu']
# }


# Create a method called get_groups that prints the animal/animals inside each group.

# Create an object called new_york_zoo and call all the methods.
# Tip: The zookeeper is the one who will use this class.
# Example
# Which animal should we add to the zoo --> Giraffe
# x.add_animal(Giraffe)

    def __init__(self, zoo_name):
        self.name = zoo_name
